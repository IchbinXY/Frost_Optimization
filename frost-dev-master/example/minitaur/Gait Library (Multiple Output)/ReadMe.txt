Here is how the GaitLibrary works: 

1. Create GaitLibrary (Output/PyBullet/2)
2. GaitLibrary.mat (Output/PyBullet/2) is created 
3. Plot Trajectory using GaitLibrary (Output/PyBullet) for verification
4. Find Solution using GaitLibrary (Output/PyBullet) 

Output contains (all phases, stride time normalized), Zhenyu's version. 
PyBullet is for importing to controller (stance phase, stance phase normalized), my version
